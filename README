fmh_gpib_core is a GPIB IP core written in VHDL.  Currently, a
frontend with a cb7210.2 (nec7210) style register interface has been 
implemented (see src/frontends/frontend_cb7210p2.vhd) and tested in a
Cyclone V HPS clocked at 60 MHz.  fmh_gpib_core supports IEEE 488.1 
subsets SH1, AH1, T5, TE5, L3, LE3, SR1, RL1, PP0-PP2, DC1, DT1, and 
C1-C5.

The underlying GPIB logic is separated from the register interface 
so that multiple front end register layouts may be implemented on top
of the common core.

See src/example/fmh_gpib_top.vhd for an example of how the cb7210.2-style
frontend might be used.  It includes a fifo with a transfer counter to
accelerate DMA transfers and a digital filter for the GPIB control lines.
A corresponding component file usable by Altera's Quartus tools can be
found under vendor/altera/.
